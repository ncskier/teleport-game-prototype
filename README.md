## Teleport Game Idea Prototype
This is the prototype for a game mechanic I came up with where a player can only move by teleporting. In the prototype, the player moves around an arena and destroys enemies.

### How to run
1. Launch your terminal
2. Navigate into the `teleport_game_prototype` directory
3. Type `python ./`

### How to Play
- Move with `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`
- Destroy enemies with your blue teleport field
- Survive as long as you can
    - `r`: restart
    - `q`: quit
